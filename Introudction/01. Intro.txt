Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.


What Python Can Do
Python serves various purposes:

It can be employed on servers to develop web applications.
It integrates with software for workflow automation.
Python interfaces with database systems and manages file operations.
It handles big data and facilitates complex mathematical computations.
Python supports rapid prototyping and robust software development.


Why Choose Python?

Python offers versatility across platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
Its straightforward syntax resembles natural language, promoting ease of use.
Python enables concise programming with fewer lines compared to other languages.
Operating on an interpreter system, Python allows immediate code execution for quick prototyping.
Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.


Additional Information

Python's latest major version is Python 3, which is the focus of this tutorial. Python 2, though no longer actively developed, remains in use primarily for security updates.
Python code can be written in text editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Thonny, PyCharm, NetBeans, or Eclipse, which are beneficial for managing larger Python projects.
Python emphasizes readability, drawing influence from both English and mathematical syntax.
Unlike many programming languages that use semicolons or parentheses to conclude commands, Python utilizes new lines.
Python uses indentation, or whitespace, to delineate scope (e.g., for loops, functions, and classes), whereas other languages commonly use curly braces for this purpose.
