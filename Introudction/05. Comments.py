# Comments in Python serve several purposes:

# They explain the purpose of code segments.
# They enhance code readability.
# They can temporarily disable code during testing without removing it.
# These practices improve code clarity and facilitate efficient debugging and maintenance.

# Creating a Comment
# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
